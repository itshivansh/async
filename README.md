## CSharp Exercise

### Asynchronous Programming with C#

1. Create a C# class named `AsyncFiles` with functions named `ReadVowelWords` , `ReadConsonantWords` these  functions takes a string filename as parameter and returns string array and add another function named `MergeFiles` which takes two string array and a string filename as argument. `ReadVowelWords` function open the given file as parameter, read  the contents and return  words  starting with a vowel in the file as a string array. The `ReadConsonantWords` function do the same process as `ReadVowelWords` function but returns words beginning with consonants. And `MergeFiles` function will create a file with the name given as parameter and writes contents of both string array which also given as parameter. Call the `ReadVowelWords` and `ReadConsonantWords` asynchronously and wait for the result and Call the `MergeFiles` function with that results.
